This project aimed to replicate the experiment conducted by Waseem and Hovy (2016) on identifying abusive language on Twitter using machine learning techniques. We retrieved tweets from the past 2-3 months using the hashtag list of Waseem and Hovy and then annotated them to train and optimize a classifier for identifying abusive language. We categorized the tweets into two categories, sexism/racism, and none. We trained various machine learning models using the Waseem dataset and then tested it on the new data. Our results showed a lower accuracy than the Waseem dataset, which led us to conclude that there may be discrepancies in the hashtags of newly annotated tweets data. We identified a major possible cause of the discrepancy: MKR hashtag mostly refers to cryptocurrency tweets instead of referring to ‘My Kitchen Rules’. In conclusion, our findings suggest that further research is needed to identify the most effective machine learning models and techniques for detecting abusive language on social media platforms.
